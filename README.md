# FractIQ: A Computational Paradigm in AI-Enhanced Trading Analytics

## 🚀 Abstract
FractIQ represents a cutting-edge integration of artificial intelligence and financial market analytics, engineered for professional traders and quantitative analysts. Leveraging advanced computational methodologies—including real-time market data acquisition, Elliott Wave Theory, Fibonacci retracement modeling, volume profiling, and order flow analytics—FractIQ delivers an intelligent framework for systematic trading optimization. Architected with modular scalability, this platform is designed to evolve alongside emergent paradigms in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance.

## 🌟 Core Functionalities
- **Dynamic Market Data Integration**: Continuous synchronization with Binance API for live streaming of price fluctuations, order book depth, and volume distribution metrics.
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of Elliott Wave and Fibonacci formations with algorithmically generated visual overlays.
- **Multi-Time Frame Analysis (MTFA)**: Cross-temporal analytics facilitating enhanced trade execution strategies.
- **Order Flow & Volume Profiling**: Real-time computational assessment of bid-ask dynamics and liquidity structures.
- **Configurable Trading Interface**: A fully customizable dashboard featuring resizable and interactive UI panels.
- **Neural-Driven Insights**: An AI-augmented analytical panel providing real-time market phase delineation and predictive trend modeling.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend Development**: React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state management)
- **Backend Architecture**: Python, FastAPI (planned), WebSockets for live data feeds
- **Database Framework**: PostgreSQL (future roadmap for backtesting archives)
- **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Docker (proposed), cloud-based hosting (AWS/GCP roadmap)
